# ScriptBar

ScriptBar is an always-on-top app for Mac OS X, through which you can run AppleScript scripts. Although in principle ScriptBar can be used to run any AppleScript script, all its built-in scripts are for commenting PDF documents in the Skim PDF viewer.

## Dependencies
* ScriptBar is a Mac OS X application and won't work on any other operating system
* ScriptBar is a Java application so you'll need to have Java installed on your Mac
* The built-in templates of ScriptBar only work with the Skim PDF viewer
* To make use of the "Feedback/Export Pages" script, you need to install the PDFTK utility from https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-server/
